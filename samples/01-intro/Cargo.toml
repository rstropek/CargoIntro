# You can influence the feature set that you need from a crate.
# The first dependency version for `regex` references all the default features.
# With that, all regex features are available and the create is optimized for performance.
# If you are parsing small strings and you need a limited set of regex features,
# you can disable default features and selectively include the features you need.
# Try all three dependency versions and read more about `regex`'s features
# at https://docs.rs/regex/1.4.6/regex/#crate-features.
# Note that the second dependency version will lead to a panic when running the app.
